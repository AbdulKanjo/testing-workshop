/*

Let's improve our error messages a bit, create a function
called `test` which can be given a title and a callback.

Then add a try/catch so you can log the title with
a note of success or error.

Then wrap each of your tests in a `test` function.

This also means that we can run all the tests even
if one of them fails!

Then run this code with `node 4`

> Make sure you're in the right directory!
