/*

Now let's implement our own assertion library.
Create a function called `expect` that accepts an "actual"
and returns an object of assertions.

Tip: I want to be able to use it like so:

> expect(actual).toBe(expected)

Then run this code with `node 3`

> Make sure you're in the right directory!
